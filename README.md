Tree Food app
=================================

An application which allows you to place an order while travelling on a train.
You can order by just selecting your favourite food, your seat and carriage number and time. You can also
get order sooner by paying extra charges.

This app demonstrates multiple fragments in an activity, a shared ViewModel across fragments,
data binding, LiveData, and the Jetpack Navigation component.
